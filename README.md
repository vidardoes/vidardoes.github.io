# Portfolio Website Repository

This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website. The website showcases my work, skills, and experiences. It is hosted on GitHub Pages and automatically updates in real time whenever there is a new commit to the repository.

## Website URL

The portfolio website is accessible at [vidardoes.github.io](https://vidardoes.github.io). Feel free to visit and explore my projects, resume, and other information.

## Development

The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to be responsive and visually appealing across different devices and screen sizes.

To set up the development environment and make changes to the website, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/vidardoes/vidardoes.github.io.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd portfolio
   ```

3. Open the files in your preferred code editor and make the necessary modifications.

4. Test your changes locally by opening the `index.html` file in a web browser.

5. Once you are satisfied with your changes, commit and push them to the repository:

   ```shell
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update portfolio website"
   git push origin main
   ```

6. GitHub Actions has been set up to automatically deploy the changes to GitHub Pages whenever there is a new commit pushed to the `main` branch. The website will be updated in real time.
